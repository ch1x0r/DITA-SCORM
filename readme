The file system hierarchy should fall as follows:

MAIN
  |
  ————-  HTML
                        |
                        | —————ENGINE
                                                |
                                                |   - - - - - -  XSL 


                 — Within the HTML DIRECTORY —
I honestly just make sure these are in the same directory as the rest. never touched the code there… no need. Clean. 

adlcp_rootv1p2.xsd
css_base_manifest.xml
images_base_manifest.xml
Ims_xml.xsd
imscp_rootv1p1p2.xsd
js_base_manifest.xml

                — Within the ENGINE DIRECTORY— 
- your personal tastes will determine the contents here - also my transform or some transform file will generate all this shit.
                 
CSS Dir
HTML Dir
IMAGES Dir JSCRIPT Dir

These files within the generated directories should be autogenerated by the code (XSL - with the autogenerated content within). 

              — Within the XSL DIRECTORY —
lessons_base_formatting-all.xsl
lessons-transform-All.xsl
plugins
quiz-utils.xsl
quiz-transform.xsl
utils.xsl



XML Files - wherever you want -  
XML Map file - Whatever they call it… just a driver file… right the MAIN file… this.xml has all your reference to the other xml  files - the driver file. What ever you kids are calling it these days. 

— DIRECTORY FOR XSL Scenarios —
Resides outside of HTML directory with Engine
Just make sure to import the right one. If you change it, Oxygen doesn’t dynamically update or whatever the transform… Maybe my set up was off. Who knows. 
Anyway, this is the transform file
